# Time spent

Together we probably spent about 12 hours. We wrote most of our code during team coding sessions.

# Files to submit
################

*.java  #Including the test case files; Please do not submit tar or zip files
README	#This file filled with the lab implementation details
Elevator.log #The name of the log file you generate should be Elevator.log.
	 # You can submit the log file along with your source code. However, 
	 # it should be generated automatically when the Elevator is executed.

# Implementation details
####################################

For testing purposes run Main.java and for now the output will be printed straight to the console. We are still working
on implementing the Elevator.log file. But we figured this should do for the initial submission. In Main() you can modify
the number of elevators, or people in the building for testing purposes. However as it is set up right now, the building
cannot have more elevators than it has floors (which also makes sense if you think about it).

For our design choice, we used a lockObject to lock on instead of implementing a busy wait.

# Feedback on the lab
####################################

The lab was a lot more fun than the last one, although it was a pain to debug.

We feel like we should get some bonus points because our implementation is 99% done and its only Friday! :)
